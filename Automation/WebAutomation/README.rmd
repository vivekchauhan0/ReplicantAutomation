export PYTHONPATH=.
/usr/bin/python3.8 mainWebTestRunner.py --MITM True --POST_DATA False --HEADLESS False

Web Socket Automation
Step 1
The solution is developed in Pycharm using Python 3.8. It is desirable to run the automation with python 3.8 as the selected intertprter.

Step 2
The solution can run on Windows, Mac and Ubuntu. Inorder to setup the required python libraries run
pipreqs WebSocketAutomation

Step 3
run this from command line

export PYTHONPATH=.
/usr/bin/python3.8 mainWebSocketRunner.py --MITM False --POST_DATA False --URL TEST
